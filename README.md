# The Odin Project - Shopping cart with React

## Built with

- React (Hooks, Context API)
- React Router

### The Assignment

Build a website that has at least two pages and a navigation bar which is shown on both routes. There should be a sticky bar at the top which displays the number of items currently in the cart, and a button where the user can go to the cart to checkout and pay (this logic will not be implemented here). On the shop page or on individual product pages, there should be an input field which lets the user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning, as well as an “Add To Cart” button. Once the user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.
